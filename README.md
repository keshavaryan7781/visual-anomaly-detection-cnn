# visual-anomaly-detection-cnn

## Overview
CNN-based system for detecting visual defects in industrial products using unsupervised learning.

## Problem Statement
In manufacturing, defective samples are rare and labeled defect data is often unavailable.

## Objective
Learn normal visual patterns and detect anomalies without supervised defect labels.

## Dataset
MVTec Anomaly Detection Dataset.

## Status
Project setup completed. Dataset exploration in progress.
